#                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
#                       Version 3, 29 June 2007
#
# Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
# Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
# of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
#
#
#  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
#the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
#License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
#
#  0. Additional Definitions.
#
#  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
#General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
#General Public License.
#
#  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
#other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
#
#  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
#by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
#Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
#of using an interface provided by the Library.
#
#  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
#Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
#with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
#Version".
#
#  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
#Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
#for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
#based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
#
#  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
#object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
#and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
#Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
#
#  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
#
#  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
#without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
#
#  2. Conveying Modified Versions.
#
#  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
#facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
#that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
#facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
#version:
#
#   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
#   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
#   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
#   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
#
#   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
#   this License applicable to that copy.
#
#  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
#
#  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
#a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
#code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
#material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
#layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
#(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
#
#   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
#   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
#   covered by this License.
#
#   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
#   document.
#
#  4. Combined Works.
#
#  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
#taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
#portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
#engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
#the following:
#
#   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
#   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
#   covered by this License.
#
#   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
#   document.
#
#   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
#   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
#   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
#   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
#
#   d) Do one of the following:
#
#       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
#       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
#       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
#       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
#       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
#       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
#       Corresponding Source.
#
#       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
#       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
#       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
#       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
#       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
#       Version.
#
#   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
#   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
#   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
#   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
#   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
#   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
#   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
#   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
#   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
#   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
#   for conveying Corresponding Source.)
#
#  5. Combined Libraries.
#
#  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
#Library side by side in a single library together with other library
#facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
#License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
#choice, if you do both of the following:
#
#   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
#   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
#   conveyed under the terms of this License.
#
#   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
#   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
#   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
#
#  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
#
#  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
#of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
#versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
#differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
#
#  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
#Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
#of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
#applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
#conditions either of that published version or of any later version
#published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
#received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
#General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
#General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
#
#  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
#whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
#apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
#permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
#Library.

#
# All it does is loop over every database and create a backup
# file.  Every database has its own direcotry beneath the root
# backup directory, $BACKUP_DIR.
#
# We're using gzip compression on each backup file and
# labeling backup files by date.  The number of backup files
# per db is controlled by $MAX_BACKUPS.
#
# The script is intended to be run by a cron job.  It echos
# messages to STDOUT which can be redirected to a file for
# simple logging.
